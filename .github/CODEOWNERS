# CODEOWNERS - Code Ownership and Review Requirements
#
# This file defines code ownership for TradePulse repository. Code owners are
# automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that
# modifies code they own.
#
# IMPORTANT: To enforce CODEOWNERS approval requirements:
# 1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Branches
# 2. Add/Edit branch protection rule for 'main' branch
# 3. Enable "Require a pull request before merging"
# 4. Enable "Require review from Code Owners"
# 5. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#
# With these settings enabled, pull requests to 'main' MUST be approved by
# at least one code owner before merging.
#
# Pattern format:
#   path/to/file.ext @username
#   path/to/directory/ @username
#   *.extension @username
#
