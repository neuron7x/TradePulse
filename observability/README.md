# Observability as Code

This directory captures the TradePulse observability stack as versioned code. All
metrics, alert rules, and dashboards live alongside the application source so
that monitoring environments can be reproduced in a deterministic manner.

## Layout

- `metrics.json` – canonical catalogue of Prometheus metrics exported by
  TradePulse services. The file documents allowed labels, metric types, and the
  owning subsystem.
- `alerts.json` – declarative Prometheus alert rule groups with severity and
  ownership metadata.
- `dashboards/` – Grafana dashboard definitions stored as JSON. Each file must
  declare a stable `uid` and at least one panel.
- `generated/` – build artefacts generated by the `observability.builder` tool.

## Building the bundle

Use the helper script to compile the definitions into consumable artefacts:

```bash
python -m tools.observability.builder --output-dir observability/generated
```

Running the command performs the following steps:

1. Validates that every metric uses a supported Prometheus type and unique name.
2. Ensures alert expressions reference known metrics and produce Prometheus rule
   files under `observability/generated/prometheus/alerts.yaml`.
3. Formats dashboards with stable JSON ordering under
   `observability/generated/dashboards/`.
4. Produces `manifest.json` with a concise summary of the bundle.

Include the generated directory when packaging infrastructure manifests or
shipping dashboards to Grafana so that staging and production remain in sync.
