# Production readiness assessment

## Executive summary
TradePulse has mature testing, observability, and security practices, but it is **not yet production ready**. While the automated test suite passes and supporting documentation is extensive, critical runtime capabilities—such as real market data connectivity, deployment automation, and hardened execution workflows—remain incomplete or only described aspirationally. The recommendations below outline the gaps that must be closed before considering a production launch.

## Strengths
- **Automated quality gates.** The repository enforces a comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, property-based, fuzz) with a 98% coverage target, and the full suite currently passes (`191 passed, 1 skipped`).【F:TESTING.md†L1-L168】【289e24†L1-L24】
- **Structured observability.** Core utilities ship with JSON structured logging (correlation IDs, operation timing) and a Prometheus metrics collector that instruments feature transforms, backtests, data ingestion, execution, and optimization flows, supported by a detailed monitoring playbook.【F:core/utils/logging.py†L1-L157】【F:core/utils/metrics.py†L1-L174】【F:docs/monitoring.md†L1-L156】
- **Security posture & processes.** The security policy defines disclosure workflows, response SLAs, and contributor checklists covering secrets management, input validation, dependency auditing, and mandatory tooling (CodeQL, Bandit, Safety, pip-audit).【F:SECURITY.md†L1-L200】

## Gaps blocking production
1. **Market connectivity is still a stub.** `AsyncDataIngestor.stream_ticks` emits synthetic ticks and the `AsyncWebSocketStream` interface raises `NotImplementedError`, so there is no actual exchange or broker integration for live data or orders.【F:core/data/async_ingestion.py†L30-L215】
2. **Execution stack is minimal.** The execution layer only exposes sizing utilities and portfolio aggregation helpers; there is no order routing, position reconciliation, or error handling that a live trading venue requires.【F:execution/order.py†L7-L36】【F:execution/risk.py†L6-L17】
3. **Deployment story is incomplete.** Docker Compose launches only the application container and Prometheus, and the README references a `docs/deployment.md` guide that does not exist, signalling missing runbooks for databases, messaging, secrets management, failover, and CI/CD rollouts.【F:docker-compose.yml†L1-L12】【F:README.md†L117-L120】
4. **Runtime dependency validation.** Tests emit fallbacks because SciPy is unavailable, even though the production requirements pin SciPy ≥1.11. Ensuring required native dependencies are installed (and captured in CI images) is critical to avoid degraded indicator fidelity in production.【F:requirements.txt†L1-L16】【289e24†L1-L24】

## Recommendations before production launch
1. Implement concrete market data and execution adapters (REST/WebSocket clients, authenticated order placement, resiliency, replay protection) and add integration tests against sandbox venues.【F:core/data/async_ingestion.py†L114-L215】
2. Extend the execution module with order state machines, persistence, and failure handling, plus risk controls (per-instrument limits, kill switches) and alerting hooks.【F:execution/order.py†L7-L36】【F:execution/risk.py†L6-L17】
3. Publish a complete deployment guide (the README link should resolve) and expand Docker Compose/Kubernetes manifests to cover supporting services (databases, caches, message buses, secret management, monitoring/alerting pipelines).【F:docker-compose.yml†L1-L12】【F:README.md†L117-L120】
4. Harden dependency management by baking SciPy and other compiled libraries into the production image, documenting system prerequisites, and updating CI to fail if runtime fallbacks are triggered.【F:requirements.txt†L1-L16】【289e24†L1-L24】
5. Validate the observability pipeline in a staging environment—exercise Prometheus scraping, structured log ingestion, and alerting workflows outlined in the monitoring guide before going live.【F:core/utils/metrics.py†L1-L174】【F:docs/monitoring.md†L1-L156】

With these items resolved, TradePulse will be significantly closer to meeting production-grade expectations for connectivity, resiliency, and operational readiness.
