# CI/CD Health Review

## Test Execution Snapshot
- `pytest` passes locally with 253 tests and 1 skipped case, confirming the Python suite is currently green.
- 18 runtime warnings surface during the run, primarily due to the Ricci curvature indicators falling back to the discrete Wasserstein approximation when SciPy is unavailable.

## Warning Analysis
- The Ricci indicator explicitly emits a `RuntimeWarning` when SciPy cannot be imported, signalling degraded numerical accuracy for curvature computations. This fallback is triggered in the local run and should be tracked in CI to avoid silent precision regressions.
- Mean Ricci feature helpers rely on the same fallback path, so the warning will appear on every execution path that touches the indicator unless SciPy is bundled in the CI environment.

## Coverage Follow-Up
- Coverage remains at 88.63 % overall, leaving a 9.37 % gap to the 98 % organisational target. The biggest shortfalls are the `core/indicators/` (87.26 %) and `core/utils/` (46.01 %) packages, which should anchor the next sprint’s test planning.
- Within the indicators package, files such as `multiscale_kuramoto.py`, `temporal_ricci.py`, and `kuramoto.py` are highlighted as critical due to missing fallback-path tests and edge-case coverage.

## Release Readiness Risks
- The latest release-readiness assessment still flags missing dependencies in the default installation path, outdated coverage expectations in the README, and gaps in user-facing documentation (deployment/installation guides).
- The web dashboard remains a stub, so any CI gate for frontend readiness should be marked experimental until a real UI is shipped.

## Recommendations
1. Install SciPy (or mock its interfaces) in the CI image to suppress fallback warnings, or update pipelines to treat the warnings as actionable items.
2. Align the dependency manifests so that out-of-the-box environments match CI expectations, eliminating historical test failures tied to missing PyYAML/Hypothesis packages.
3. Prioritise coverage improvements in `core/indicators/` and `core/utils/`, focusing on the fallback execution paths called out in the coverage report.
4. Close documentation gaps identified in the release assessment before promoting any release candidate.
