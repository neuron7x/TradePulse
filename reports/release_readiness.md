# Release Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary
TradePulse provides a functional core for algorithmic trading — including indicator computation, a walk-forward backtester, and a CLI that links indicators to execution workflows — but the project is **not yet ready for a production-grade release**. The latest sprint tightened operational guardrails: reliability-critical modules (`core.indicators.kuramoto`, `core.utils.slo`, and `core.utils.security`) now sit above 93 % unit coverage, GPU fallbacks and auto-rollback flows are regression-tested, and a production cutover readiness checklist formalises SLO, alerting, on-call, and incident playbook expectations. Nevertheless, broader platform coverage remains well below the 98 % target and several product-facing capabilities are incomplete.

## Evidence of Maturity
- **Cohesive CLI workflow.** The CLI combines geometric indicators, entropy metrics, Ricci curvature, backtesting, and live CSV streaming into actionable commands for analyze/backtest/live modes, demonstrating an integrated pipeline from data to signals. 【F:interfaces/cli.py†L1-L135】
- **Deterministic backtesting engine.** The vectorised walk-forward engine already calculates P&L, drawdowns, and trade counts with guard rails on input validation. 【F:backtest/engine.py†L1-L35】
- **Documented architecture and monitoring practices.** High-level docs describe modular boundaries and provide observability guidelines, supporting future operations work. 【F:README.md†L134-L155】【F:docs/monitoring.md†L1-L158】

## Release Blockers
- **Coverage below strategic target.** Core reliability surfaces now exceed 93 % coverage, but the overall codebase still sits near 67 %, far from the documented 98 % ambition. Focus next on backtest/execution stratification and data ingestion paths. 【F:tests/unit/indicators/test_kuramoto_fallbacks.py†L1-L166】【F:tests/unit/utils/test_slo.py†L1-L104】【F:tests/unit/utils/test_security.py†L1-L60】【c97d7a†L1-L8】
- **Missing referenced documentation.** The README links to `docs/deployment.md` and `docs/installation.md`, but these files are absent, leaving installation and deployment instructions incomplete. 【F:README.md†L72-L99】【440232†L1-L4】
- **Frontend still a stub.** The Next.js dashboard consists of a single placeholder string, so there is no production-ready UI. 【F:apps/web/app/page.tsx†L1-L3】

## Additional Gaps to Address
- **Infrastructure & deployment playbooks.** A production cutover readiness checklist codifies infra hardening, alert coverage, on-call routines, and incident playbooks; ensure engineering leadership reviews and signs off before go-live. 【F:reports/prod_cutover_readiness_checklist.md†L1-L39】
- **Dependency hygiene.** Development requirements now include the runtime stack, so installing `requirements-dev.txt` brings in Hypothesis/pytest automatically; contributor docs were updated to highlight the single-step setup. 【F:requirements-dev.txt†L1-L15】【F:CONTRIBUTING.md†L68-L80】
- **Operational parity.** Several documentation promises (e.g., protocol buffer interfaces, microservice engines) lack corresponding implementation or deployment guides in the repo snapshot, suggesting marketing material outpaces available code. 【F:README.md†L49-L155】

## Operational Readiness Progress (Issue #98)
- **Infrastructure** – Auto-rollback guard now guards key SLOs with explicit cooldown semantics, and the readiness checklist mandates infrastructure sign-off before cutover. 【F:core/utils/slo.py†L1-L204】【F:tests/unit/utils/test_slo.py†L1-L104】【F:reports/prod_cutover_readiness_checklist.md†L6-L22】
- **Monitoring & alerting** – Kuramoto GPU fallback emits warnings, metric collectors are exercised in tests, and alert coverage is itemised in the readiness checklist. 【F:core/indicators/kuramoto.py†L1-L189】【F:tests/unit/indicators/test_kuramoto_fallbacks.py†L1-L166】【F:reports/prod_cutover_readiness_checklist.md†L24-L31】
- **Deployment** – Cutover checklist establishes go/no-go criteria, on-call responsibilities, and rollback drills for deployment rehearsals. 【F:reports/prod_cutover_readiness_checklist.md†L33-L39】
- **Security** – Secret detection utilities now have regression coverage, ensuring high-signal alerting and masked findings during incident response. 【F:core/utils/security.py†L1-L154】【F:tests/unit/utils/test_security.py†L1-L60】【F:reports/prod_cutover_readiness_checklist.md†L33-L39】



## Recommendations
1. Extend high-density coverage beyond reliability modules to backtest, execution, and data ingestion layers to close the gap to the 98 % goal.
2. Restore or write the missing installation/deployment documentation so onboarding and operations match README promises.
3. Flesh out the web dashboard or mark it experimental to set accurate user expectations.
4. Reconcile README claims with implemented services to avoid misaligned release notes.
5. Automate readiness checklist validation in CI (e.g., linting for SLO thresholds and alert mappings).
