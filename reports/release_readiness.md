# Release Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary
TradePulse continues to present a production-focused architecture with comprehensive documentation, rich indicator coverage, and
an extensible execution stack. However, automated quality gates still block a production launch. Stabilising the dependency mat
rix, restoring the advertised 98 % coverage target, and aligning the shipped artefacts with the documentation remain mandatory s
teps before tagging a release.

## Readiness Scorecard
| Capability                        | Status | Notes |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Dependency hygiene               | ⚠️     | `PyYAML` and `hypothesis` are required by default test paths; both are now listed in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`, but a clean environment must be verified via CI. |
| Automated test execution         | ❌     | `pytest -q` previously failed on missing dependencies; the suite must be re-run and stabilised after dependency updates. |
| Coverage threshold (98 %)        | ❌     | Current coverage is documented at 56 %, substantially below the published quality bar in the README. |
| Operations documentation         | ✅     | Architecture, monitoring, troubleshooting, installation, and deployment guides are published; ensure updates stay in lockstep with implementation changes. |
| Front-end readiness              | ❌     | The Next.js dashboard still renders only a placeholder string with no production UX. |

## Evidence of Maturity
- **Cohesive CLI workflow.** The CLI binds geometric indicators, entropy metrics, Ricci curvature, backtesting, and live streami
ng into actionable commands for analysis, simulation, and execution. 【F:interfaces/cli.py†L1-L135】
- **Deterministic backtesting engine.** The walk-forward engine computes P&L, drawdowns, and trade counts with deterministic out
puts and guard rails on input validation. 【F:backtest/engine.py†L1-L35】
- **Documented architecture and monitoring.** Architecture, monitoring, troubleshooting, and FAQ guides provide in-depth explana
tions that support production-grade operations once quality gaps are resolved. 【F:DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md†L1-L120】

## Critical Release Blockers
1. **Re-run automated tests with full dependencies.** Confirm `pytest` passes locally and in CI after the dependency manifest cha
nges.
2. **Close the coverage gap.** Prioritise core execution, risk, and indicator modules until the documented 98 % target is met.
3. **Validate deployment runbooks.** Keep the newly published `docs/installation.md` and `docs/deployment.md` aligned with the repository state and ensure the README links remain accurate.
4. **Clarify UI status.** Either build the dashboard to MVP functionality or mark it experimental to avoid misleading release no
tes.

## Integration & Optimisation Plan
- **Phase 1 – Dependency verification.**
  - Lock PyYAML/Hypothesis versions and add them to CI cache warm-ups.
  - Document the `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` workflow in both README and TESTING g
uides.
  - Add a smoke-test job that exercises CLI commands relying on YAML strategy definitions.
- **Phase 2 – Quality instrumentation.**
  - Expand property tests around risk management and order routing to boost coverage with minimal maintenance.
  - Enable `pytest --cov-fail-under=98` locally and in CI to prevent regressions once the target is met.
  - Capture Hypothesis statistics to identify flaky generators before release.
- **Phase 3 – Operational alignment.**
  - Maintain installation and deployment runbooks so README promises stay accurate.
  - Document monitoring dashboards that reflect implemented metrics and alerts.
  - Produce a public release checklist (see `docs/quality-assurance.md`) covering smoke tests, observability, and rollback proced
ures.

## Current Recommendation
Hold the production release until the above phases are completed and verified in CI. Once dependency stability, test reliability,
and documentation completeness are demonstrated, TradePulse will be ready for a tagged launch with confidence in runtime behaviou
r.
