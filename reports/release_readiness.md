# Release Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary
TradePulse provides a functional core for algorithmic trading — including indicator computation, a walk-forward backtester, and a CLI that links indicators to execution workflows — but the project is **not yet ready for a production-grade release**. Several critical gaps remain: the automated test suite fails on a clean checkout because required dependencies are missing, coverage is well below the documented target, operations documentation referenced in the README is absent, and the web dashboard is still a placeholder. Addressing these issues should precede any public launch.

## Evidence of Maturity
- **Cohesive CLI workflow.** The CLI combines geometric indicators, entropy metrics, Ricci curvature, backtesting, and live CSV streaming into actionable commands for analyze/backtest/live modes, demonstrating an integrated pipeline from data to signals. 【F:interfaces/cli.py†L1-L135】
- **Deterministic backtesting engine.** The vectorised walk-forward engine already calculates P&L, drawdowns, and trade counts with guard rails on input validation. 【F:backtest/engine.py†L1-L35】
- **Documented architecture and monitoring practices.** High-level docs describe modular boundaries and provide observability guidelines, supporting future operations work. 【F:README.md†L134-L155】【F:docs/monitoring.md†L1-L158】

## Release Blockers
- **Automated tests fail out-of-the-box.** `pytest` aborts because the property-based suite requires PyYAML, which is neither vendored nor listed in the default requirements, causing an ImportError before tests run. 【5d57c7†L1-L16】【F:interfaces/cli.py†L36-L48】【F:requirements.txt†L1-L7】
- **Coverage far below target.** The README advertises only 56 % coverage while the stated target is 98 %, indicating major untested paths relative to expectations. 【F:README.md†L101-L130】
- **Missing referenced documentation.** The README links to `docs/deployment.md` and `docs/installation.md`, but these files are absent, leaving installation and deployment instructions incomplete. 【F:README.md†L72-L99】【440232†L1-L4】
- **Frontend still a stub.** The Next.js dashboard consists of a single placeholder string, so there is no production-ready UI. 【F:apps/web/app/page.tsx†L1-L3】

## Additional Gaps to Address
- **Dependency hygiene.** Development requirements now include the runtime stack, so installing `requirements-dev.txt` brings in Hypothesis/pytest automatically; contributor docs were updated to highlight the single-step setup. 【F:requirements-dev.txt†L1-L15】【F:CONTRIBUTING.md†L68-L80】
- **Operational parity.** Several documentation promises (e.g., protocol buffer interfaces, microservice engines) lack corresponding implementation or deployment guides in the repo snapshot, suggesting marketing material outpaces available code. 【F:README.md†L49-L155】

## Recommendations
1. Fix the dependency manifest (add PyYAML to `requirements.txt` or gate YAML usage) and ensure `pytest` passes on a clean environment; enforce this in CI.
2. Prioritise test coverage improvements toward the advertised 98 % goal, focusing on critical trading logic and risk modules.
3. Restore or write the missing installation/deployment documentation so onboarding and operations match README promises.
4. Flesh out the web dashboard or mark it experimental to set accurate user expectations.
5. Reconcile README claims with implemented services to avoid misaligned release notes.
