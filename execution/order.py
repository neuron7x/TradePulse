"""Order sizing utilities anchored in governance-aligned risk budgeting.

The sizing rules here implement the capital allocation policy referenced in
``docs/execution.md`` and the risk controls catalogue in
``docs/risk_ml_observability.md``. The default :class:`RiskAwarePositionSizer`
respects leverage caps, fractional risk budgets, and floating-point safety
margins, ensuring orders remain within the guardrails mandated by the
