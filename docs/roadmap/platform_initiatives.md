# Platform Initiatives Roadmap

This document captures the execution blueprint for the next wave of platform capabilities. Each section expands the requested initiatives with goals, scope, delivery milestones, and validation requirements.

## 1. [A/B-Live] Daily Portfolio Comparison with Confidence Intervals
- **Objective:** Deliver an always-on comparative analytics loop that measures live strategy performance against the baseline portfolio.
- **Scope:**
  - Instrument ingestion and normalization of both live and baseline portfolio valuations at daily frequency.
  - Calculate relative performance deltas and variance measures using bootstrapped confidence intervals (95% default, configurable per report).
  - Provide daily reports via dashboard export and scheduled delivery (email/Slack) with drill-downs to strategy, asset, and risk-factor slices.
- **Milestones:**
  1. Extend analytics pipeline with dual-source data ingestion and schema alignment.
  2. Implement statistical engine for confidence interval computation with parameterized lookback windows.
  3. Wire automated reporting jobs and persistence (warehouse + object storage).
- **Validation:** Integration tests for data alignment, statistical accuracy regression suite, and monitored alerting on missing data or degraded coverage.

## 2. [Snapshot] Market/Portfolio Snapshots & Live Session Replay
- **Objective:** Capture reproducible snapshots of market state and portfolio exposures, enabling replay of live sessions inside the backtesting framework.
- **Scope:**
  - Persist full market data ticks, order book depth, and portfolio state deltas at configurable cadence.
  - Store deterministic seeds, RNG state, and environment metadata to guarantee parity between live capture and replay.
  - Extend backtest runner to hydrate from snapshot bundles and reproduce execution flows.
- **Milestones:**
  1. Define snapshot schema and storage layout (metadata index + binary payloads).
  2. Implement capture agents for live trading services with minimal latency overhead.
  3. Enhance backtest CLI/API to load snapshots, execute replays, and emit comparison metrics.
- **Validation:** Replay parity tests (P&L, fills, latency) within tolerance bands, plus performance benchmarks on snapshot serialization/deserialization.

## 3. [Snapshot] Config/Artifact Versioning & Audit Trail
- **Objective:** Provide full traceability across configurations, model artifacts, and operational decisions for compliance review.
- **Scope:**
  - Introduce versioned configuration registry with immutable history and diff tooling.
  - Archive model binaries, feature stores, and release metadata at key lifecycle events (deployments, rollbacks, incident triggers).
  - Generate audit trail entries linking configuration/artifact versions to execution logs and approvals.
- **Milestones:**
  1. Stand up metadata service (backed by Postgres + object storage) with signed manifest support.
  2. Integrate CI/CD and deployment workflows with automatic artifact registration.
  3. Build review dashboards and export tooling for regulatory/compliance teams.
- **Validation:** Automated integrity checksums, signature verification tests, and compliance acceptance runbooks.

## 4. [Compat] ARM (Apple Silicon) Compatibility & SIMD Verification
- **Objective:** Guarantee first-class support for arm64 environments across build, packaging, and runtime performance paths.
- **Scope:**
  - Add CI matrix for Apple M-series runners covering unit/integration suites.
  - Produce arm64 wheels/containers with deterministic build pipelines.
  - Expand SIMD code paths to include NEON implementations with feature detection.
- **Milestones:**
  1. Provision arm64 CI workers and update workflows (GitHub Actions, Buildkite) with architecture-specific stages.
  2. Patch build scripts (Python, Rust, Go) for cross-compilation and universal binary output.
  3. Implement SIMD abstraction layer tests comparing x86-64 vs arm64 results and throughput.
- **Validation:** Contract tests for compiled artifacts, benchmark parity reports, and smoke tests on Apple Silicon hardware.

## 5. [Compat] Broker API Compatibility & Contract Testing
- **Objective:** Ensure stable connectivity and behavior across supported broker integrations via automated contract tests.
- **Scope:**
  - Catalog API surface area for each broker (authentication, market data, order entry, account management).
  - Develop mock servers and fixtures replicating broker-specific edge cases and throttling rules.
  - Embed compatibility suites into CI with version pinning and schema validation.
- **Milestones:**
  1. Build broker capability matrix and priority backlog.
  2. Implement reusable contract test harness with scenario scripting.
  3. Establish monitoring for production API drift and automated re-validation cadence.
- **Validation:** Passing contract suites, adherence to SLAs, and real-world pilot confirmations.

## 6. [Lifecycle] Standardized Makefile Workflows
- **Objective:** Harmonize developer workflows via a single Makefile covering linting, formatting, type checks, testing, benchmarking, docs, SBOM generation, and release packaging.
- **Scope:**
  - Audit existing scripts (Python, Go, Rust) and consolidate under Make targets with consistent naming.
  - Provide environment bootstrapping helpers (virtualenv, toolchain install) and caching strategies.
  - Document usage patterns and integrate with CI pipelines.
- **Milestones:**
  1. Draft Makefile spec aligning commands to `fmt`, `lint`, `type`, `test`, `bench`, `docs`, `sbom`, `release`.
  2. Migrate legacy scripts and ensure idempotency.
  3. Update developer onboarding docs and enforce via pre-commit hooks.
- **Validation:** CI adoption metrics, developer feedback surveys, and reduced onboarding time.

## 7. [Lifecycle] Automated CHANGELOG & Signed Artifacts
- **Objective:** Automate release notes generation and guarantee artifact authenticity.
- **Scope:**
  - Implement Conventional Commits enforcement (lint + PR templates) feeding changelog generator.
  - Integrate release tooling to sign binaries, wheels, and container images (e.g., Sigstore/Cosign).
  - Publish changelog updates and signature manifests as part of release pipeline.
- **Milestones:**
  1. Configure commit linting and changelog automation (Release Please, semantic-release, or equivalent).
  2. Extend CI/CD with signing steps and key management (KMS/HSM-backed).
  3. Provide verification tooling for consumers and document validation steps.
- **Validation:** Signed artifact verification in CI, audit log coverage, and release process dry-runs.

## Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Documentation:** Keep MkDocs site updated with how-to guides, API references, and compliance notes for each initiative.
- **Security & Compliance:** Apply threat modeling and privacy reviews for data capture features, especially snapshot storage.
- **Project Management:** Maintain Kanban epics with quarterly OKRs and clear ownership per initiative.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identify rollback strategies, monitoring KPIs, and escalation paths prior to rollout.

## Next Steps
1. Socialize this roadmap with platform leads for validation and prioritization.
2. Convert milestones into tracked epics/stories with estimated effort and dependencies.
3. Establish recurring review cadence (bi-weekly) to monitor progress and adjust scope as needed.
