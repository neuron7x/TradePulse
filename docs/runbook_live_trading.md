# Live Trading Runbook

This runbook documents the operational procedures for running the live execution
stack backed by `execution.live_loop.LiveExecutionLoop`. It is intended for
operators who are responsible for starting, monitoring, and shutting down live
trading sessions.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

1. **Infrastructure readiness** – confirm that market data feeds, network
   routes, and authentication secrets are available for every configured
   exchange connector.
2. **Risk controls** – verify that the `RiskManager` limits reflect the latest
   risk committee directives and that the kill-switch has been reset after the
   previous trading session.
3. **State directory** – ensure the state directory configured in
   `LiveLoopConfig.state_dir` is writeable and backed up. Historical OMS state
   files are required for warm restarts and forensic analysis.
4. **Metrics and logging** – confirm that the Prometheus collector and log
   aggregation pipelines are running to capture structured events emitted by
   the live loop.

## Cold Start Procedure

Cold starts are used when deploying a new strategy instance or when the prior
state is intentionally discarded.

1. **Initialise the loop**
   ```python
   from execution.live_loop import LiveExecutionLoop, LiveLoopConfig
   from execution.risk import RiskLimits, RiskManager

   config = LiveLoopConfig(state_dir="/var/lib/tradepulse/live")
   risk = RiskManager(RiskLimits(...))
   loop = LiveExecutionLoop({"binance": binance_connector}, risk, config=config)
   loop.start(cold_start=True)
   ```
2. **Hydrate OMS from disk** – the cold start path reloads persisted OMS state
   and clears transient in-memory queues. Any outstanding open orders will be
   re-registered for fill tracking.
3. **Submit orders** – use `loop.submit_order(venue, order, correlation_id)` to
   enqueue new orders. The background submission thread handles placement and
   retries.
4. **Monitor metrics** – dashboards should display the
   `live_loop.*` structured logs, order placement metrics, and per-venue
   heartbeat gauges.

## Warm Start / Restart Procedure

Warm starts resume trading after a controlled shutdown or short outage.

1. **Instantiate with persisted state** – reuse the existing state directory
   and connectors when constructing `LiveExecutionLoop`.
2. **Start in warm mode** – call `loop.start(cold_start=False)`. The live loop
   will:
   - Load persisted OMS state including queued and outstanding orders.
   - Fetch `open_orders()` from each connector to reconcile venue state.
   - Re-enqueue orders that were persisted but missing on the venue.
   - Adopt orphaned venue orders into the OMS to maintain risk accounting.
3. **Validate reconciliation** – check logs for `live_loop.requeue_order` and
   `live_loop.adopt_order` events to confirm that discrepancies were addressed.
4. **Resume trading** – orders can be submitted immediately after the warm
   start completes.

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Structured logs** – the loop emits JSON-friendly logs such as
  `live_loop.order_processed`, `live_loop.register_fill`, and
  `live_loop.heartbeat_retry`. Forward these to the incident dashboard.
- **Metrics** – Prometheus counters and gauges are updated via
  `core.utils.metrics` for order placements, acknowledgements, fills, and
  positions. Ensure dashboards alert on stalled submissions or missing heartbeats.
- **Lifecycle hooks** – subscribe to `on_kill_switch`, `on_reconnect`, and
  `on_position_snapshot` to integrate with alerting or downstream systems.

## Failure Handling

- **Connector disconnects** – heartbeat failures trigger exponential backoff
  retries and emit `on_reconnect` events. Investigate repeated retries and be
  prepared to fail over if the venue remains unreachable.
- **Order discrepancies** – warm start reconciliation produces warnings when
  orders are re-queued or adopted. Operators should confirm that downstream
  systems (P&L, hedging) reflect the corrected state.
- **Kill-switch activation** – when the risk kill-switch triggers, the live loop
  stops all background tasks, emits `on_kill_switch`, and requires manual
  intervention before restarting. Investigate the root cause before resetting
  the switch.

## Shutdown Procedure

1. Call `loop.shutdown()` to stop background workers and disconnect connectors.
2. Confirm that no orders remain queued and that OMS state files were persisted.
3. Archive logs and metrics for the session as part of the post-trade review.

## Contacts and Escalation

- **Execution engineering on-call** – primary contact for connector incidents.
- **Risk management** – escalation path for kill-switch or limit breaches.
- **Operations** – responsible for scheduling and communication during planned
  maintenance windows.

Keep this runbook up to date alongside changes to `execution/live_loop.py` and
related operational tooling.
