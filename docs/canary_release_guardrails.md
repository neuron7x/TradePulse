# Canary Release Guardrails for TradePulse Deployments

## Purpose and Scope
This playbook defines the safety rails for promoting new versions of TradePulse services through staged, canary-based deployments. It aligns production risk management with business outcomes by specifying:

- Quantitative thresholds for market-facing impact (PnL volatility, order execution latency, error budgets).
- Technical guardrails that drive automated rollback and halt criteria.
- Observability, alerting, and governance hooks that ensure every release decision is auditable.

The guidance applies to every production-bound deployment in equities, derivatives, and crypto execution clusters. Teams must adapt cluster-specific parameters but cannot relax the mandatory guardrails without governance approval.

### Pre-flight Readiness Checklist
- Change request in `governance/change_log.md` approved with sign-off from trading, risk, and SRE leads.
- Synthetic order replay in `backtest/canary_validation.py` completed with zero schema or checksum diffs.
- Dashboard snapshots for baseline services exported to `reports/baselines/<deployment_id>/` to enable delta comparisons.
- Alert suppression windows for non-related alerts documented to avoid masking regressions.

## Release Phases and Traffic Allocation
| Phase | Traffic Share | Duration | Objectives |
|-------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Pre-flight validation | 0% (shadow only) | 15 minutes minimum | Replay latest real market feed to the new build. Validate basic health checks, schema compatibility, and warm caches. |
| Canary Phase 1 | 1% of market-making orders, 0.5% of agency flow | 20 minutes minimum | Confirm no regression in core health KPIs vs. control. Enable detailed tracing and per-order logging. |
| Canary Phase 2 | 5% of market-making, 2% of agency flow | 30 minutes minimum | Exercise broader order types and venues. Evaluate PnL, latency, and reject ratios against guardrails. |
| Canary Phase 3 | 15% of market-making, 5% of agency flow | 45 minutes minimum | Validate stability under burst traffic scenarios. Confirm guardrails remain within green band. |
| General Availability | 100% | Until next release | Promote once all canary checkpoints pass, change tickets closed, and sign-off recorded. |

**Rules:**

- Canary routing is enforced via the deployment controller (see `deploy/traffic_splitter.yaml`) with immutable manifests checked into Git.
- Traffic shares apply at the per-venue level; never co-mingle canary and baseline orders within the same market data session.
- Deviations from the schedule require incident-commander authorization logged in the release record.

## Technical Guardrails and Thresholds
All metrics are computed as rolling windows over the phase duration with 2-minute sampling. Thresholds marked "hard" trigger an immediate rollback; "soft" requires manual review and extension of the canary window.

### Metric Calculation Principles
- **Control Selection:** For each venue, the canary slice is matched against the most recent baseline orders with the same order type, symbol bucket, and client segment. Baseline queries are issued via `analytics/queries/control_cohort.sql`.
- **Delta Computation:** Deltas are calculated as `(canary_value - control_value) / control_value` for ratios and `canary_value - control_value` for latency/PnL expressed in absolute units.
- **Confidence Enforcement:** Guardrail comparisons require a minimum of 500 filled orders or 5 minutes of data (whichever is later). The deployment controller automatically pauses phase advancement until the sample size condition is met.
- **Anomaly Filtering:** Metrics ingest from Prometheus is guarded by a 3-sigma outlier filter defined in `observability/promql/canary_common.libsonnet`. Filtered samples are still logged for audit but excluded from automated rollbacks.

### Core Stability Metrics
| Metric | Baseline Source | Soft Threshold | Hard Threshold | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Order acceptance error rate | `execution.order_accept.failures` | +25% over control | +40% over control | Compare to matched baseline traffic. |
| Risk engine latency (p95) | `risk.latency.p95_ms` | +15% | +25% | Latency measured pre-trade. |
| Matching latency (p99) | `execution.match.latency.p99_ms` | +10% | +20% | Venue-specific; apply tightest venue limit. |
| Quote staleness (p50) | `markets.quotes.age_ms` | +15% | +30% | Monitored per symbol bucket. |
| CPU saturation | `infra.host.cpu_utilization` | 80% | 90% | Hard breach fires auto rollback. |
| Memory headroom | `infra.host.mem_available_pct` | 20% | 10% | Hard breach fires auto rollback. |

### Business Impact Metrics
| Metric | Baseline Source | Soft Threshold | Hard Threshold | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Realized PnL delta | `pnl.realized.delta_bps` | ±5 bps | ±8 bps | Compute vs. control bucket normalized for exposure. |
| Mark-to-market drift | `pnl.unrealized.drift_bps` | ±4 bps | ±6 bps | Adjust for market beta using hedging desk factor model. |
| Missed spread capture | `execution.spread_capture.effective_bps` | -5% | -8% | Applies to market making strategies only. |
| Agency order fill ratio | `execution.agency.fill_ratio` | -3% | -5% | Weighted by client priority tier. |

### Phase Exit Criteria
To progress from one phase to the next, **all** of the following must be true for the trailing five samples:

1. No hard threshold breached.
2. Fewer than two soft thresholds breached, and the cumulative guardrail risk score (see below) ≤ 2.
3. No Sev-1 or Sev-2 incidents open in PagerDuty service `tradepulse-prod`.
4. Release commander has uploaded the metric diff snapshot to `reports/release_decisions/<deployment_id>/phase_<n>/`.

The guardrail risk score is computed as the sum of risk weights for soft-breached metrics using `analytics/calc_guardrail_score.py`:

| Metric Category | Risk Weight |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Core stability metric | 1.0 |
| Business impact metric | 0.8 |
| Data quality metric | 1.2 |

Any single soft breach persisting for more than 10 consecutive minutes escalates to the incident commander for a go/no-go decision.

### Data Quality and Risk Controls
- **Schema Guardrails:** Any breaking change detected by schema diff (`schemas/*`) aborts deployment pre-flight.
- **Reference Data Freshness:** `data.refdata.age_minutes` must remain below 5 minutes; breach triggers rollback.
- **Model Drift:** Canary uses `analytics/model_guardian.py` checks; drift score > 0.35 halts promotion.

## Automated Rollback Logic

1. Deployment controller subscribes to guardrail metrics via Prometheus Alertmanager webhooks.
2. When a hard threshold fires, `deploy/canary_guardian.py` executes:
   - Freeze new order intake for canary pods (via Kubernetes PodDisruptionBudget adjustment).
   - Drain existing sessions gracefully (timeout 10 seconds) to avoid orphaned orders.
   - Redeploy baseline revision (`kustomize build deploy/overlays/prod | kubectl apply -f -`).
   - Record rollback reason, metric snapshot, and operator on-call acknowledgement in `reports/release_decisions/`.
3. Soft threshold alerts route to the release commander Slack channel (`#deploy-ops`). Manual override requires documented rationale in the release decision log.

Rollback automation is tested quarterly in the chaos game day (see `docs/resilience.md`).

### Rollback Decision Matrix
| Trigger | Automated Action | Human in the Loop | Additional Logging |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Hard threshold breach | Immediate rollback workflow | Incident commander acknowledges in PagerDuty | Metric snapshot + Kubernetes event dump stored in `reports/release_decisions/<deployment_id>/rollback/`. |
| Repeated soft threshold (≥3 breaches within 15 minutes) | Hold at current traffic split | Release commander decides within 10 minutes | Append rationale to decision log, export Grafana comparison PNGs. |
| Observability gap (missing metrics, >2 consecutive samples) | Freeze phase advancement, raise warning | SRE on-call validates exporters | Prometheus query + scrape status appended to log. |
| Manual abort request | Drain canary pods, revert manifests | Release commander approval required | Change ticket cross-referenced in log entry. |

## Observability and Alerting Integration

- **Dashboards:** Grafana folder `TradePulse/Canary` hosts phase-specific dashboards with synchronized time ranges for baseline vs. canary comparisons.
- **Alerting:**
  - Critical guardrails use PagerDuty service `tradepulse-prod` with a 5-minute auto-escalation.
  - Warning-level guardrails trigger Slack and create Jira ticket via OpsGenie integration.
- **Tracing:** Enable 100% sampling for canary pods via `observability/tracing_config.yaml`. Retain spans for 72 hours.
- **Log Enrichment:** Canary pods append `deployment_id`, `phase`, and `traffic_share` fields to structured logs to support post-mortems.

## Decision Logging and Audit Trail

Every phase transition requires updating `reports/release_decisions/<deployment_id>.yaml` with:

```yaml
phase: canary_phase_2
approver: jane.doe@tradepulse.ai
start_timestamp: 2024-05-16T21:15:00Z
traffic_share:
  market_making: 0.05
  agency: 0.02
metrics_snapshot:
  execution.match.latency.p99_ms: 6.8
  pnl.realized.delta_bps: 1.1
notes: "Latency normalized after cache warmup. Proceeding to phase 3."
```

Decision logs are immutable once GA is reached and retained for at least 12 months.

## Safe Release Reporting

- **Daily Canary Report:** Generated automatically by `reports/generate_canary_report.py`. Summarizes guardrail adherence, breaches, and rollback outcomes. Distributed to trading ops, risk, and product leads.
- **Monthly Safety Review:** Aggregates canary performance across releases, highlights recurring guardrail breaches, and updates threshold proposals.
- **Regulatory Archive:** Export sanitized reports and decision logs to the compliance vault (`infra/compliance/retention_bucket`) within 24 hours of GA.

### Report Quality Gates
- Reports must include distribution plots for `execution.match.latency.p99_ms` and `pnl.realized.delta_bps` with control overlays.
- Any rollback event requires attachment of the final Alertmanager payload and PagerDuty timeline.
- Compliance vault uploads are verified via checksum comparison logged in `reports/release_decisions/<deployment_id>/checksums.txt`.

## Governance and Continuous Improvement

- Guardrail thresholds are reviewed quarterly with stakeholders from trading, risk, and SRE. Updates require sign-off recorded in `governance/change_log.md`.
- Any production incident attributable to a guardrail gap triggers an ADR to refine the framework.
- Teams must document experiments that propose loosening thresholds, including Monte Carlo backtests demonstrating risk neutrality.

Adhering to these guardrails ensures canary releases protect both client outcomes and TradePulse's PnL while enabling rapid, safe iteration.
