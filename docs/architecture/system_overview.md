# TradePulse Architecture Overview

This page outlines the core TradePulse architecture through contextual, interaction, and data flow diagrams to support onboarding and operational planning.

## System Context

TradePulse combines ingestion pipelines, a unified data platform, analytics services, and delivery channels for traders, quants, and downstream systems.

    participant ETL as Streaming ETL
    participant Lake as Feature Lake
    participant Strat as Strategy Engine
    participant Exec as Execution Gateway
    participant UI as Trader UI

    Src->>Conn: Publish market snapshot
