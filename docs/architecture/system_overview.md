# TradePulse Architecture Overview

This page outlines the core TradePulse architecture through contextual, interaction, and data flow diagrams to support onboarding and operational planning.

## System Context

TradePulse combines ingestion pipelines, a unified data platform, analytics services, and delivery channels for traders, quants, and downstream systems.

The underlying Mermaid source is available at [`assets/system_overview.mmd`](assets/system_overview.mmd) for version-controlled updates.

## Component Interactions

The diagram source is stored alongside the rendered asset at [`assets/service_interactions.mmd`](assets/service_interactions.mmd).

## Data Flow and Governance
