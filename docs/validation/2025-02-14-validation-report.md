# Validation Report - 2025-02-14

## Environment Preparation
- Created an isolated virtual environment with the repository's development dependencies.
- Dependencies installed via `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

## Linters
- `ruff check` produced 1,091 issues, primarily formatting violations (e.g., long lines) and import-ordering warnings across `tests/` and `tools/vendor/fpma/` modules. Many issues are auto-fixable with `ruff --fix`.

## Type Checking
- `mypy .` flagged missing type stubs for `yaml` usages in multiple modules and a module duplication warning for `cli/tradepulse_cli.py`.

## Test Suite
- `pytest` executed the entire suite: **696 passed**, **6 skipped**, **0 failed** in ~23s.
- Skips were due to optional dependencies (`polars`, parquet backends, `tradepulse_accel`).
- Numerous runtime warnings observed (e.g., SciPy fallbacks, numerical overflows) but no test failures.

## Recommendations
1. Address `ruff` formatting/import issues to keep codebase compliant.
2. Install `types-PyYAML` or add stub ignores for `yaml` imports to satisfy `mypy`.
3. Resolve the duplicate module path for `cli/tradepulse_cli.py` (consider package layout adjustments or `--explicit-package-bases`).
4. Investigate frequent numerical warnings in Ricci indicator tests to ensure expected behavior.
