# Validation Report - 2025-02-14

## Environment Preparation
- Created an isolated virtual environment with the repository's development dependencies.
- Installed tooling via `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

## Linters (`ruff check`)
- `ruff check` surfaced **1,091** findings across `tests/` and `tools/vendor/fpma/`.
- Most issues are formatting-related (line length, import ordering); **565** are auto-fixable with `ruff --fix` (additional fixes available with `--unsafe-fixes`).

## Commit Message Lint (`commitlint`)
- Both the local run (`commitlint --from HEAD~1 --to HEAD`) and the GitHub Action (`wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v6`) failed because the latest commit body contains lines longer than the enforced **100-character** limit (`body-max-line-length`).
- Break long body lines into multiple sentences or bullets (or link out to longer context) so that each line stays under 100 characters before pushing.
- Re-run `npx commitlint --from HEAD~1 --to HEAD` locally to confirm the fix before opening a PR to avoid CI failures.

## Type Checking (`mypy .`)
- `mypy` reported missing stubs for the `yaml` dependency within several modules (`backtest/transaction_costs.py`, `core/config/kuramoto_ricci.py`, `core/config/template_manager.py`, `interfaces/cli.py`).
- Duplicate module discovery for `cli/tradepulse_cli.py` (seen as both `tradepulse_cli` and `cli.tradepulse_cli`), suggesting the need for package layout adjustments or explicit package bases.

## Test Suite (`pytest`)
- `pytest` executed successfully with **646 passed**, **15 skipped**, **23 warnings** in ~11s.
- Skipped suites stem from optional dependencies (`hypothesis`, `polars`, Parquet backends, `tradepulse_accel`).
- Observed runtime warnings highlight SciPy fallbacks in Ricci curvature calculations and temporal Ricci analyzers resetting state on non-monotonic timestamps.

## Recommendations
1. Apply `ruff --fix` (and optionally `--unsafe-fixes`) to resolve the bulk of linting issues, then address any remaining violations manually.
2. Install `types-PyYAML` (or add targeted `type: ignore` directives) to satisfy `mypy`'s `yaml` import complaints.
3. Resolve the duplicate module mapping for `cli/tradepulse_cli.py` via package structure updates or by running `mypy` with `--explicit-package-bases`.
4. Investigate recurring runtime warnings in Ricci indicator tests to confirm they are expected under current dependency constraints.
