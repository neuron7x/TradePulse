# Chaos Testing (GameDay) Guide

Ensure TradePulse stays resilient under failure by running structured GameDay exercises that simulate production incidents. This playbook covers planning, executing, and learning from controlled failure injections so teams can validate both system reliability and operational response.

## Purpose

Chaos testing ("GameDay") validates three critical capabilities:

1. **Resilience** – The platform should degrade gracefully and recover quickly.
2. **Operational Excellence** – Teams must detect, triage, and remediate incidents without supervision.
3. **Learning Culture** – Exercises should produce concrete improvements to architecture, runbooks, and tooling.

GameDays are not ad-hoc firefights. Treat them as repeatable experiments with measurable outcomes.

## Program Structure

| Cadence | Environment | Scope | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quarterly | Staging mirrors production | Cross-service failures (data, execution, UI) | Successful recovery and follow-up actions logged |
| Monthly | Team-owned sandbox | Component-level chaos (e.g., order routing, indicator service) | Updated playbooks and alert tuning completed |
| Continuous | Production (opt-in) | Lightweight fault injection with safeguards | Error budget preserved, automated rollback validated |

Document every run in the Resilience journal (`reports/resilience/`). Link metrics dashboards and incident timelines for traceability.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **GameDay Lead** – designs scenarios, schedules participants, ensures safety controls.
- **Failure Engineer** – implements and executes the fault injections.
- **Observers/Scribes** – capture timeline, metrics, operator decisions.
- **Responders** – follow standard incident response playbooks.
- **Stakeholders** – review findings, approve remediation backlog.

Rotate roles to build organizational resiliency and avoid single points of knowledge.

## Preparing a GameDay

1. **Define Objectives** – Example: "Validate order throttling during exchange latency spikes."
2. **Select Scope** – Choose one or two services to avoid spreading focus too thin.
3. **Baseline Metrics** – Capture key SLOs (latency, throughput, error rate) before injecting failures.
4. **Safety Guards** – Establish blast radius limits, traffic shaping, and instant rollback commands.
5. **Communications Plan** – Announce schedule, participants, and support channels 48 hours in advance.
6. **Success Criteria** – Agree on what constitutes recovery (e.g., queues drain <5 minutes, alerts fire within 60 seconds).

Maintain a GameDay charter template in your team workspace to ensure consistency.

## Failure Injection Scenarios

> Tip: Start with high-probability, high-impact failures before moving to rare edge cases.

| Area | Scenario | Signals | Recovery Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Market Data | Upstream feed latency spike | Data freshness, queue depth | Auto-failover activates <2 minutes |
| Execution | Exchange API rate limiting | Order rejection rate, retry counts | Circuit breaker engages, order backlog cleared |
| Core Services | Indicator engine crash loop | Pod restarts, task lag | Self-healing completes, metrics restored |
| Infrastructure | Database failover to replica | Replication lag, connection errors | Zero data loss, traders notified |
| Operations | Pager fatigue simulation | Mean time to acknowledge | Escalation policy validated |

Each scenario should include: prerequisites, precise failure injection steps, monitoring dashboards, expected alerts, and rollback procedure.

---

## Running the Exercise

1. **Kickoff** – Reconfirm objectives, safety limits, and success criteria.
2. **Inject Failure** – Execute pre-approved scripts or tooling (e.g., `chaos-mesh`, `toxiproxy`, Terraform toggle).
3. **Observe** – Track metrics, logs, and traces; ensure observers log timestamps.
4. **Respond** – Allow on-call responders to use their standard runbooks without hints.
5. **Stabilize** – Verify system health matches baseline SLOs and capture evidence (dashboards, logs).
6. **Revert** – Roll back injected failures and confirm no lingering issues.

Timebox each GameDay to 90–120 minutes to maintain focus and energy.

---

## Observability and Success Metrics

Measure both technical and human performance:

- **Detection**: Time from fault injection to first alert/on-call acknowledgement.
- **Diagnosis**: Time to identify root cause and impacted components.
- **Mitigation**: Time to restore service or activate fallback.
- **Post-Recovery**: Error budgets consumed, customer impact, backlog health.
- **Runbook Quality**: Were steps clear? Did responders improvise? Capture gaps.

Benchmark these metrics against service-level objectives (SLOs) to prioritize improvements.

---

## Incident Response Expectations

During a GameDay, responders must follow the same incident process as production:

1. Declare incident severity and record it in the incident tracker.
2. Assign clear roles (incident commander, communications lead, subject-matter experts).
3. Provide customer comms templates for status pages and account managers.
4. Keep timelines updated every 15 minutes for stakeholders.
5. Document temporary workarounds and verify they are removed after stabilization.

Encourage psychological safety—call out process gaps, not people.

---

## Post-Event Review

Within 24 hours, conduct a blameless retro covering:

- What signals detected the issue? Were any missing?
- Which hypotheses were considered? Which evidence validated them?
- Where did runbooks or tooling help, and where did they slow responders?
- Which action items will materially improve resilience?

Create follow-up issues with owners, due dates, and impact descriptions. Track completion in the resilience backlog.

---

## Automation and Tooling

Recommended tooling stack:

- **Failure Injection**: `chaos-mesh`, `gremlin`, custom Kubernetes jobs, load-shedding toggles.
- **Traffic Shaping**: `toxiproxy`, service mesh fault injection, feature flags.
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, Loki log aggregation, Tempo/Jaeger tracing.
- **Runbooks**: Centralized knowledge base integrated with alerting (PagerDuty, Opsgenie).
- **Reporting**: Automated timeline exports, Slack bots for event summaries.

Automate replay of high-value scenarios as part of CI/CD or nightly chaos suites where safe.

## Appendix: Sample Timeline

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| T-7 days | Publish GameDay plan, confirm environment, align stakeholders |
| T-2 days | Dry run failure scripts, validate observability dashboards |
| T-0 | Kickoff, inject failure, monitor response |
| T+60 min | Recovery confirmed, begin structured debrief |
| T+1 day | Publish retro report, track follow-up actions |
| T+30 days | Review remediation progress, decide next scenario |

Consistent, well-instrumented GameDays build confidence that TradePulse will withstand real-world market turbulence and infrastructure incidents.
