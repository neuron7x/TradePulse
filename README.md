## üîç Overview

TradePulse is engineered as a cross-language research platform for professional quants. Python modules implement signal generation, feature engineering, and orchestration; Go services handle latency-sensitive market microstructure analysis. Async pipelines, GPU fallbacks, and strict typing make it possible to move seamlessly between research notebooks and production trading workflows.

Use TradePulse to:

- Build composite market regimes with Kuramoto, Ricci, entropy, and Hurst indicators.
- Run walk-forward simulations that mirror production latency and fee constraints.
- Execute adaptive market-making or directional strategies with built-in risk controls.
- Observe live systems through Prometheus metrics, structured logging, and Grafana dashboards.

## üöÄ Platform Capabilities

### Research & Signal Generation
- `core/indicators/` provides Kuramoto, multiscale Kuramoto, Ricci curvature, entropy, and Hurst exponent implementations with caching utilities.
- `core/phase/` fuses indicators into phase transition detectors, while `core/metrics/` codifies evaluation metrics.
- `core/data/` contains adapters for CSV/stream ingestion, async pipelines, validation, and preprocessing helpers (e.g., float32 scaling, chunked transformations).
- GPU acceleration is available through `compute_phase_gpu` when CuPy is installed, enabling high-frequency experiments.

### Portfolio & Execution
- `backtest/` implements the event-driven engine, walk-forward runner, strategy hooks, resampling, and transaction-cost modelling.
- `execution/` houses order models, AMM integration, and risk controls designed for latency-aware execution.
- `interfaces/` exposes CLIs, ingestion layers, and dashboard streaming endpoints; `apps/web/` contains the Next.js monitoring dashboard.

### Operational Excellence
- `observability/` packages Prometheus metrics definitions, alert policies, and Grafana dashboards for monitoring deployments.
- `reports/` aggregates CI outputs (coverage, static analysis, dependency audit) that support release readiness reviews.
- `deploy/` and `docker-compose.yml` encode reproducible environments for local clusters or staging rollouts.

## üìä Data & Indicators

- **Kuramoto Synchronisation** (`core/indicators/kuramoto.py`, `core/indicators/multiscale_kuramoto.py`) analyses collective price phases across time scales.
- **Ricci Curvature** (`core/indicators/ricci.py`, `core/indicators/temporal_ricci.py`) measures structural stress within price graphs to anticipate regime shifts.
- **Entropy & Delta Entropy** (`core/indicators/entropy.py`) quantify uncertainty dynamics, with configurable binning and float32 support.
- **Hurst Exponent** (`core/indicators/hurst.py`) classifies persistence vs. mean-reversion regimes.
- **Composite Transitions** (`core/phase/detector.py`) merges the above signals into interpretable phase flags and triggers.
- **Agent Toolkit** (`core/agent/`) includes reinforcement and evolutionary components for automated strategy search.
- **Datasets** live under [`data/`](data/) and [`sample.csv`](sample.csv), while [`docs/dataset_catalog.md`](docs/dataset_catalog.md) documents recommended market feeds.

## üîÅ Workflow Playbooks

### Quant Research Loop
1. Start in a notebook or script using primitives from `core/indicators` and `core/data.preprocess` to explore candidate alphas.
2. Persist experiments using [`reports/`](reports/) conventions or [`analytics/`](analytics/) services for reproducible datasets.
3. Promote promising features into `core/strategies/` or `core/agent/` for automated tuning.

### Walk-Forward Backtesting
```bash
# Example: evaluate a strategy with realistic transaction costs
python -m interfaces.cli backtest --csv sample.csv \
    --train-window 500 --test-window 100 \
    --fee 0.0005
```
- `backtest/engine.py` orchestrates walk-forward windows, while `backtest/performance.py` reports PnL, drawdowns, and trade stats.
- Extend behaviour via `backtest/strategies/` or by injecting callbacks into `walk_forward`.

### Live Execution Demo
```bash
# Simulate live processing from a CSV feed with GPU acceleration
python -m interfaces.cli live --source csv --path sample.csv --window 200 --gpu
```
- `core/data.ingestion.DataIngestor` streams ticks, `core/phase/detector.py` emits composite signals, and JSON output is ready for downstream execution engines.
- For production integrations, connect interfaces in [`execution/`](execution/) or bridge to Go services under [`markets/`](markets/).

## üß∞ Installation

### Python Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuron7x/TradePulse.git
cd TradePulse
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt          # runtime stack
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt      # linting, testing, docs
```
- Optional extras: install `cupy` for GPU-accelerated phase computations and `pyyaml` for CLI config overlays.

### Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose up -d        # start ingestion, analytics, and dashboards
docker compose logs -f      # follow service output
docker compose down         # stop the stack
```
See [docs/docker-quickstart.md](docs/docker-quickstart.md) for GPU passthrough, environment variables, and troubleshooting.

### Documentation Site
