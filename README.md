## 🔍 Overview

TradePulse delivers end-to-end tooling for quantitative research teams:

- High-fidelity indicators derived from differential geometry and dynamical systems.
- Walk-forward backtesting and live execution loops powered by async pipelines.
- GPU-accelerated performance primitives and observability baked in.
- A cross-language architecture spanning Python and Go for mission-critical workloads.

Whether you are prototyping strategies or orchestrating production trading bots, TradePulse provides production-ready scaffolding that remains flexible for experimentation.

> **Production status:** TradePulse is suitable for research, experimentation, and GitHub releases, but it is **not** ready for production live trading yet. Review the [Production Readiness Assessment](docs/production-readiness.md) for the outstanding work on live execution, exchange integrations, real-market testing, risk controls, documentation, and dashboards before considering deployment.

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Analyze Market Data

```bash
# Analyze CSV data
python -m interfaces.cli analyze --csv sample.csv --window 200

# Output includes Kuramoto order, entropy, Ricci curvature, Hurst exponent
```

### Run Backtest

```bash
# Walk-forward backtest with custom strategy
python -m interfaces.cli backtest --csv sample.csv \
    --train-window 500 --test-window 100 \
    --initial-capital 10000
```

### Performance-Optimized Processing

```python
import numpy as np
from core.indicators.entropy import EntropyFeature
from core.indicators.hurst import HurstFeature
from core.data.preprocess import scale_series

# Large dataset (1M points)
large_data = np.random.randn(1_000_000)

# Memory-efficient processing with float32 (50% memory savings)
entropy_feat = EntropyFeature(
    bins=50,
    use_float32=True,
    chunk_size=100_000,
)

# Compute indicators
result = entropy_feat.transform(large_data)
print(f"Entropy: {result.value:.4f}")

# Scale data efficiently
scaled = scale_series(large_data, use_float32=True)

# See docs/performance.md for the complete guide
```

### Live Trading (Demo)

```bash
# Simulate live trading from CSV
python -m interfaces.cli live --source csv --path sample.csv --window 200
```

See [Usage Examples](docs/examples/) and [Performance Demo](examples/performance_demo.py) for more detailed examples.

## 🧪 Testing

TradePulse relies on an extensive pytest testbed covering unit, integration, property-based, async, fuzz, and performance scenarios. The latest results and coverage are always available from the CI badges above, and full reports (HTML coverage, `coverage.xml`) are attached to each successful build.

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage and HTML report
pytest tests/ --cov=core --cov=backtest --cov=execution --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html:coverage_html

# Skip slow tests during development
pytest tests/ -m "not slow"

# Run only property-based tests
pytest tests/property/

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

Refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) and [TESTING_SUMMARY.md](TESTING_SUMMARY.md) for deeper insights into coverage targets, fixtures, and workflow integration.
