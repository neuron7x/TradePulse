## 📦 Release Automation

TradePulse relies on [Release Drafter v6](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to generate GitHub release drafts whenever commits land on `main`.

- **Triggering** – the workflow runs on every push to `main` and can be re-run manually via `workflow_dispatch`. Use the `force-refresh` input set to `true` when you need to rebuild the draft after re-tagging or relabeling pull requests.
- **Semantic labels** – pull requests tagged with `feature`, `bug`, or `chore` are automatically grouped into feature, fix, and maintenance sections. Additional labels `breaking`, `semver:major`, `semver:minor`, and `semver:patch` influence the semantic version that the resolver proposes.
- **Autolabeler sync** – the Release Drafter autolabeler heuristics add semantic labels based on branch prefixes (`feature/`, `hotfix/`) and pull-request titles that start with `feat`, `fix`, or `chore`. Adjust these rules inside `.github/release-drafter.yml` if your workflow conventions change.
- **Token permissions** – the workflow operates with the minimal permissions needed: `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`. No `pull_request_target` triggers are used, so there are no security warnings about elevated contexts.
- **Caching & metrics** – the workflow fetches the full git history (tags included) so version resolution has access to previous releases. The summary posted to the GitHub run contains start/finish timestamps, total processed pull requests, and the generated draft URL for quick validation.

> 🔄 **Dry run tip:** Create a throwaway tag (for example `git tag -a v0.0.0-test -m "Release drafter dry run" && git push origin v0.0.0-test`) and dispatch the workflow with `force-refresh=true` to validate the output without affecting production releases. Delete the tag afterwards (`git push origin :refs/tags/v0.0.0-test`).

### Example draft body

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation with `pip`

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neuron7x/TradePulse.git
cd TradePulse

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install runtime dependencies (use the lock file for reproducibility)
pip install -r requirements.lock

# Install development & test tooling (extends the runtime lock)
pip install -r requirements-dev.lock

# Optional extras (install only what you need)
# pip install ".[connectors]"  # market & broker integrations
# pip install ".[gpu]"         # GPU acceleration backends
# pip install ".[docs]"        # documentation toolchain
```

### Installation with Docker

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down
```

> **Security hardening defaults**
>
> - The image is built via a multi-stage pipeline that ends on `gcr.io/distroless/python3`, runs as the locked-down `nonroot` user (UID/GID `65532`), and sets a strict `umask` via the container entrypoint.
> - The Compose service enforces a read-only root filesystem, mounts `/tmp` on a `tmpfs`, drops privilege escalation with `no-new-privileges`, and pins the container to Docker's default seccomp/AppArmor profiles.
> - Runtime secrets are **not** baked into the image. The entrypoint reads an optional `/run/secrets/tradepulse.env` file so secrets can be injected at deploy time without ever touching the Compose file.
> - Port `8001` does not require extra Linux capabilities. If you remap the service to a privileged port (`<1024`), add `cap_add: ["NET_BIND_SERVICE"]` (or grant the capability through your orchestrator) and document the approval with your security team.

#### Injecting secrets from an external manager

1. **Sync secrets into Docker** – Pull the payload from your secret manager and create a short-lived Docker secret:

   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id tradepulse/prod \
     --query 'SecretString' --output text > /tmp/tradepulse.env
   docker secret create tradepulse_env /tmp/tradepulse.env
   rm -f /tmp/tradepulse.env
   ```

   > Replace the AWS CLI call with your provider (HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager, etc.).

2. **Mount the secret** – Create an override file so the secret is surfaced at `/run/secrets/tradepulse.env` with the correct ownership:

   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.override.yml
   services:
     tradepulse:
       secrets:
         - source: tradepulse_env
           target: tradepulse.env
           uid: "65532"
           gid: "65532"
           mode: 0440

   secrets:
     tradepulse_env:
       external: true
   ```

3. **Launch the stack** – `docker compose up -d` will now make the secret available inside the container. The hardened entrypoint automatically sources each `KEY=VALUE` pair before executing `python -m nfpro`.

Rotate secrets directly in your manager and re-run step 1 to refresh the mounted payload without editing version-controlled files.

See the [Docker Quick Start Guide](docs/docker-quickstart.md) for detailed instructions, including GPU setup and troubleshooting tips.

```bash
# Walk-forward backtest with custom strategy
python -m interfaces.cli backtest --csv sample.csv \
    --train-window 500 --test-window 100 \
    --initial-capital 10000
```

### Performance-Optimized Processing

```python
import numpy as np
from core.indicators.entropy import EntropyFeature
from core.indicators.hurst import HurstFeature
from core.data.preprocess import scale_series

# Large dataset (1M points)
large_data = np.random.randn(1_000_000)

# Memory-efficient processing with float32 (50% memory savings)
entropy_feat = EntropyFeature(
    bins=50,
    use_float32=True,
    chunk_size=100_000,
)

# Compute indicators
result = entropy_feat.transform(large_data)
print(f"Entropy: {result.value:.4f}")

# Scale data efficiently
scaled = scale_series(large_data, use_float32=True)

# See docs/performance.md for the complete guide
```

### Live Trading (Demo)

```bash
# Simulate live trading from CSV
python -m interfaces.cli live --source csv --path sample.csv --window 200
```

### Streamlit Dashboard

TradePulse includes a web-based dashboard built with Streamlit for real-time market analysis visualization.

#### Authentication Setup

The dashboard requires authentication for security. Configure credentials via environment variables:

```bash
# 1. Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Generate a secure password hash (example using Python)
python -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw('your_secure_password'.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())"

# 3. Update .env with your credentials
# DASHBOARD_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
# DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=<your_generated_hash>
# DASHBOARD_COOKIE_KEY=<generate_random_key>  # e.g., python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

#### Running the Dashboard

```bash
# Install Streamlit dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the dashboard
streamlit run interfaces/dashboard_streamlit.py

# The dashboard will open at http://localhost:8501
# Login with the credentials configured in .env
```

**Default credentials (development only):**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123` (⚠️ Change this in production!)

**Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Always use strong passwords in production
- Generate unique cookie keys for each environment
- Password hashes are stored using bcrypt for security

See [Usage Examples](docs/examples/) and [Performance Demo](examples/performance_demo.py) for more detailed examples.
