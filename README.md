## 2025 Reference Core

The 2025 refresh introduces a reproducible, Hydra-configured trading core with three reference strategies (trend following, mean-reversion, and AMM liquidity provision), a unified risk manager, MLflow experiment logging, and production-grade TCA reporting. Configuration groups under `conf/` enable Optuna sweeps, volatility targeting, and execution venue selection while walk-forward + purged CV validation ensures robust research workflows.

## 🔍 Overview

TradePulse delivers end-to-end tooling for quantitative research teams:

- High-fidelity indicators derived from differential geometry and dynamical systems.
- Walk-forward backtesting and live execution loops powered by async pipelines.
- GPU-accelerated performance primitives and observability baked in.
- A cross-language architecture spanning Python and Go for mission-critical workloads.

Whether you are prototyping strategies or orchestrating production trading bots, TradePulse provides production-ready scaffolding that remains flexible for experimentation.

> **Production status:** TradePulse is suitable for research, experimentation, and GitHub releases, but it is **not** ready for production live trading yet. Review the [Production Readiness Assessment](docs/production-readiness.md) for the outstanding work on live execution, exchange integrations, real-market testing, risk controls, documentation, and dashboards before considering deployment.

## 📦 Release Automation

TradePulse relies on [Release Drafter v6](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to generate GitHub release drafts whenever commits land on `main`.

- **Triggering** – the workflow runs on every push to `main` and can be re-run manually via `workflow_dispatch`. Use the `force-refresh` input set to `true` when you need to rebuild the draft after re-tagging or relabeling pull requests.
- **Semantic labels** – pull requests tagged with `feature`, `bug`, or `chore` are automatically grouped into feature, fix, and maintenance sections. Additional labels `breaking`, `semver:major`, `semver:minor`, and `semver:patch` influence the semantic version that the resolver proposes.
- **Autolabeler sync** – the Release Drafter autolabeler heuristics add semantic labels based on branch prefixes (`feature/`, `hotfix/`) and pull-request titles that start with `feat`, `fix`, or `chore`. Adjust these rules inside `.github/release-drafter.yml` if your workflow conventions change.
- **Token permissions** – the workflow operates with the minimal permissions needed: `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`. No `pull_request_target` triggers are used, so there are no security warnings about elevated contexts.
- **Caching & metrics** – the workflow fetches the full git history (tags included) so version resolution has access to previous releases. The summary posted to the GitHub run contains start/finish timestamps, total processed pull requests, and the generated draft URL for quick validation.

> 🔄 **Dry run tip:** Create a throwaway tag (for example `git tag -a v0.0.0-test -m "Release drafter dry run" && git push origin v0.0.0-test`) and dispatch the workflow with `force-refresh=true` to validate the output without affecting production releases. Delete the tag afterwards (`git push origin :refs/tags/v0.0.0-test`).

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Analyze Market Data

```bash
# Analyze CSV data
python -m interfaces.cli analyze --csv sample.csv --window 200

# Output includes Kuramoto order, entropy, Ricci curvature, Hurst exponent
```

### Run Backtest

```bash
# Walk-forward backtest with custom strategy
python -m interfaces.cli backtest --csv sample.csv \
    --train-window 500 --test-window 100 \
    --initial-capital 10000
```

### Performance-Optimized Processing

```python
import numpy as np
from core.indicators.entropy import EntropyFeature
from core.indicators.hurst import HurstFeature
from core.data.preprocess import scale_series

# Large dataset (1M points)
large_data = np.random.randn(1_000_000)

# Memory-efficient processing with float32 (50% memory savings)
entropy_feat = EntropyFeature(
    bins=50,
    use_float32=True,
    chunk_size=100_000,
)

# Compute indicators
result = entropy_feat.transform(large_data)
print(f"Entropy: {result.value:.4f}")

# Scale data efficiently
scaled = scale_series(large_data, use_float32=True)

# See docs/performance.md for the complete guide
```

### Live Trading (Demo)

```bash
# Simulate live trading from CSV
python -m interfaces.cli live --source csv --path sample.csv --window 200
```

### Streamlit Dashboard

TradePulse includes a web-based dashboard built with Streamlit for real-time market analysis visualization.

#### Authentication Setup

The dashboard requires authentication for security. Configure credentials via environment variables:

```bash
# 1. Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Generate a secure password hash (example using Python)
python -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw('your_secure_password'.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())"

# 3. Update .env with your credentials
# DASHBOARD_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
# DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=<your_generated_hash>
# DASHBOARD_COOKIE_KEY=<generate_random_key>  # e.g., python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

#### Running the Dashboard

```bash
# Install Streamlit dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the dashboard
streamlit run interfaces/dashboard_streamlit.py

# The dashboard will open at http://localhost:8501
# Login with the credentials configured in .env
```

**Default credentials (development only):**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123` (⚠️ Change this in production!)

**Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Always use strong passwords in production
- Generate unique cookie keys for each environment
- Password hashes are stored using bcrypt for security

See [Usage Examples](docs/examples/) and [Performance Demo](examples/performance_demo.py) for more detailed examples.
